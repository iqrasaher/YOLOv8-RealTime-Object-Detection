# YOLOv8-RealTime-Object-Detection
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model with OpenCV and cvzone. It captures live video from a webcam, detects objects, and displays bounding boxes with confidence scores and labels. Supporting 80 classes, it offers an efficient, visually enhanced solution for object recognition in live video streams.
